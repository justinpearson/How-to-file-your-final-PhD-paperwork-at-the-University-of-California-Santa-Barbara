Terminology
-----------

- PQ: ProQuest -- publisher of thesises? Just UCSB or other institutions?
- IR: Institutional repository: ucsb's IR stores theses
- ETD: electronic thesis or dissertation
- "awarded" = "conferred"
- When folks say "your degree is dated / conferred / filed on Mar 2018", they mean the date on transcript & diploma.


Questions
---------

- why would anyone embargo (delay) the publication of their thesis?
    - may need to keep hidden bc of a pending publication or patent
- 'open access' -- bad if you want to try to get your thesis published afterward. (is this true?)
    - I did Open Access.
    - Gail McMillan's article says only 45% publishers would consider publishing thesis if it was already open-access.
        - http://archive.gradpost.ucsb.edu/tools/2014/5/5/dont-fear-the-open-access-etd-electronic-thesis-and-disserta.html
- In STEM, worth it to copyright thesis? Why do or don't?
- Diploma: $19 charged to BARC (WON'T I BE SEPARATED ALREADY? Not sure. BARC tells you your status.)
- Diploma: when mailed? A: A couple months after Grad Div tells you you've satisfied all the criteria.
- Submit to Grad Div
    1. original signature page (8.5x11")
        - Q: is this the page in my thesis? A: Yes, but the page in the thesis is left blank, whereas you print out a separate page 
    1. Copy of title page
        - Q: Like from thesis? A: Yes.
- Q: How notified when (1) Grad Div finished reviewing package? A: They email you.
- Q: How set up mail fwding of jppearson@ucsb.edu ? Not sure, I think it's forwarded for a year.
- Q: How do employers verify my PhD?
    - Note: not many employers verify.
    - A: They can pay for an official transcript (they need to provide personal info on you) or an official verification (has less info than a transcript)
        - This takes a few months for UCSB to send to the "national student clearing house" your degree info, ugh.
    - Q: What if I need to be verifiale right away? A: Most employers accept the Grad Div email.
- Q: How tell when all done? Like, BARC paid off, all business finished?
- Q: How pay filing fee? How much? A: Half of student services fee = $358/2 = $188.
    - Note: Only have to pay the filing fee if you're on a leave of absence, bc if you're registered your fees pay for it already.
    - THere's a $20 fee to petition to go on a "filing leave of absence".
- ProQuest publishes theses for just UCSB or lots of campuses? What do they do exactly?
- Q: Who cares about when their degree is dated?
- Note: Next qtr fees will be applied. You should cancel your next qtr in GOLD: GOLD -> left side -> "petitions" -> "cancel quarter". 
    - If LOA, wouls also have to cancel the following qtr as wel.

Filing leave of absence
-------------------------- 

http://www.graddiv.ucsb.edu/academic/leave-of-absence/filing-leave-of-absence


The Filing Leave of Absence (LOA) enables graduate students who have fulfilled all degree requirements except the final examination and filing of the master’s thesis, doctoral dissertation, supporting document (DMA students), or completion of master’s comprehensive examination or project to take a Filing LOA in lieu of registering. All research and a substantial portion of the thesis/dissertation/DMA supporting document must be drafted prior to the Filing leave quarter. 

Students on leave of absence are not registered students and therefore relinquish most student privileges and resources such as extensive use of faculty time.



Copyright
----------

- you own copyright
- can put copyright on 3rd page of thesis
- can register copyright w/ US copyright office
    - proquest offers reg for a fee (~$50) but you can do yourself



Filing Deadlines
-------------------

Each qtr, 2 deadlines:

1. Last day of the qtr (degree dated for that qtr)
    - ex: to have degree dated Fall 2017, should file everything by Dec 15 (or Dec 8?), 2017
2. Start of next qtr (degree dated that next qtr)
    - ex: turn in Jan 5, 2018 (right before winter qtr begins), degree is dated for winter 2018.
